# Croct React Case

This is my atempt to show a fraction of what I can do using a tool developed by the Croct Team. Who had this awesome idea:

The technology can be programmed to collect useful information about the user such as location, interests and many more. That way, we can offer a customized service to any costumer, and that gave me the final idea to make a simple recipe app.

## What does the app?

In this application, the user can check or search a collection of recipes if its his first time in the site. But as soon he like a recipe or check them too many times, the system will understand wich meals he like the most, and will start to recomend more recipes like that.

In the profile page, the user can check which recipes he liked and from wich nacionality the recipes are from.

## Technical Decisions

I saw an opportunity to reuse various parts of the App (like the recipe thumb), so I decided to go to React. But while I know croct uses Typescript a lot, my studies haven't included React.ts (yet). My goal is to use the typed text in the backend with express for now.

Also, I was thinking about implementing a global state system like redux or context API to keep some data as the user's preferred recipes. But I thought "Hey, I have a croct to store my user information, duh". So I intensified my studies with the croct SDK.

Last but not least, I remember hearing that the app didn't have to be pretty and stuff. But I couldn't help it, I love design, so I tried to make a 5 hour CSS for the entire app. And to practice and learn, I did all the CSS manually.

Although I am currently studying back end fervently, it would take a long time to model and implement a back end, with that said, I decided to make an illustrative login page. **The app has nothing like back end**.

## Human Decisions

At the beginning I was attached to several ideas and the brainstorming phase was fantastic for me. I wanted to do something crazy and out of the box, the ideas were to sell clouds (literally clouds), a tree exhibit and a system to manage a zoo and its employees. I was thinking "Well, the user can search for a specific animal, and then when he comes to my site, I want to put out a big picture of an elephant if my client is interested." But after a few hours of exercising my unpredictable imagination, I came to the conclusion that not everyone can understand my eccentric ideas, so I decided to stick to something more "real life". The good news is that I haven't given up on the zoo idea. The final list of projects included:

- Zoo landing page.

- E-commerce gym.

- Recipe app.

And I think I was hungry at the time, so I chose the Recipe XD app. Welcome!
